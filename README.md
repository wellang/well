# About
	
### This is a small project made by yours truly (TristanWellman). This is a high level assembly language, you will have your low level assembly programming but with some features from high level languages. Wellang compiles directly to assembly(NASM), See below for compilation and simple documentation.

	move~ 0, rdi 
	return

}

```

## Vim syntax highlighting

make vim
```

if it says you don't have ``~/.vim/syntax/`` or ``~/.vim/ftdetect/`` then you can do
```
cd {path/to/.vim}
mkdir syntax && mkdir ftdetect
```
